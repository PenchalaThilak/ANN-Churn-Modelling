📊 ANN Churn Modelling
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Python to model and predict customer churn — whether a customer will leave a service or not.

🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major issue in many industries. This project aims to predict churn using a neural network trained on customer data, helping businesses improve retention strategies.

🚀 Technologies Used
